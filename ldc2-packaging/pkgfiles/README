This is a standalone (DMD-style) binary package for LDC,
the LLVM-based D compiler.

No installation is required. Just make sure that the system
linker (i.e., gcc) is on the executable search path when
running the compiler.

The compiler configuration file is etc/ldc2.conf, and by
default only import/ resp. import/ldc/ are on the module
search path.

For further information, including on how to report bugs,
please refer to the LDC wiki: http://wiki.dlang.org/LDC.
